    I was diagnosed with a wheat allergy when I was 14. I spent the last six years trying to find replacements for the treats 
    I can no longer have. I understand the struggle of being gluten-free in this world.
    Here at Payton's Bakery, we are passionate about creating gluten-free treats that everyone can enjoy! Our mission 
    is to prove that gluten-free baked goods can be just as tasty as traditional ones. Every item is handcrafted in our
    dedicated gluten-free kitchen , ensuring there is no cross-contamination. Each recipe is carefully tested to guarantee 
    it tastes as amazing as it looks. Whether you're celiac, gluten intolerant, or simply looking for something new, we invite you to join
    our bakery family. Gluten free doesn't mean compromise.
